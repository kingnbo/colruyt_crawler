# colruyt_crawler

#This is a simple crawler that goes through the different pages of a food category on colruyt.be. This code still needs a bit of tweaking because it requires too much user input.
#
#To run this code:
#
#1.Choose the category you would like to get products from.
#
#2.Replace this category in line 37 of colruyt_crawler.py example : replace "Viande" with "Boisson"
#
#3.Perform a search on colruyt.be for the keyword Boisson and check at the bottom of the page the number of pages of results you have.
#
#4.Change the condition on line 80 to if n== the number of pages when searching for Boisson on colruyt.be + 1 (92+1=93)
#
#5.To see the prices on colruyt.be you need to be signed up. Create an account and change the credentials on line 29 with your username and line 31 with your password.
#
#6.run the code BUT make sure the chrome browser window that opens is full screen and that the cookies notification bar (grey bar at the bottom of the page) is hidden. (Click on "Masquer cette notification")
#
#7.The code should then run if you keep the chorme browser window visible on your screen.
